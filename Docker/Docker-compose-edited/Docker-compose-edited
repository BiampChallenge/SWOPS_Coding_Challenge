#  Here are some best practices to optimize this Docker Compose file:

    # Use a specific version of the Docker Compose file format, instead of using the latest version. This ensures that the file will work with the intended version of Docker Compose. For example, you can use version "3.9" if your Docker Compose version supports it.

    # Use the official image for the base image, instead of building it from a Dockerfile. This can save time and reduce the size of the image. For example, you can use the official Debian image instead of building a custom Debian image.

    # Use named volumes instead of bind mounts for persistent storage. Named volumes provide better performance, manageability, and portability than bind mounts. For example, you can use a named volume to store the user's home directory data.

    # Avoid using privileged mode unless it is absolutely necessary. Privileged mode can pose a security risk and should be used with caution. If possible, try to use a more restrictive set of capabilities or use user namespaces instead.
