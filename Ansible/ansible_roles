#An Ansible role is a collection of related tasks, templates, files, and variables that are grouped together in a structured way to be reused and shared across multiple playbooks. 
#Roles help to organize and simplify complex automation tasks, making it easier to maintain and scale infrastructure deployments. Roles can also be shared with others in the community, making it easier to collaborate and build upon existing automation solutions.
